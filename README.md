# curve25519
----------

This module provides two functionality :

1. Provides x25519 function, which performs scalar multiplication on the elliptic curve known as Curve25519
2. Elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) key exchange protocol that allows two parties, each having an elliptic curve public–private key pair, to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel. Currently, its only support Curve25519.

## About curve25519

Curve25519 is an elliptic curve that offers 128 security bits and is designed for use in 
the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement key design scheme.

## Installation
